## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the **AI-Powered Salary Prediction App**! This Streamlit application leverages machine learning to predict annual salaries based on various personal and professional attributes such as age, gender, education level, years of experience, and job title.

Whether you're negotiating a new salary, exploring career options, or just curious about market rates, this app provides data-driven insights to help you make informed decisions.

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Input:** User-friendly sliders and select boxes for entering personal and professional details.
* **Real-time Prediction:** Get instant salary predictions powered by a robust machine learning model.
* **Salary Range Estimation:** Provides a reasonable upper and lower bound around the predicted salary.
* **Dynamic Insights:** Offers insights on how education and experience might impact future earnings.
* **Model Transparency:** Displays key information about the underlying machine learning model.
* **Responsive UI:** Built with Streamlit for a clean and intuitive user experience.

## 🧠 How it Works

The application uses a **Random Forest Regressor** model, trained on a comprehensive salary dataset (`Salary_Data.csv`). The model learns patterns between features like age, education, experience, and job roles to predict salaries.

During the training phase (detailed in `Salary Prediction.ipynb`), categorical features like 'Gender', 'Education Level', and 'Job Title' were numerically encoded (e.g., one-hot encoding for job titles with `drop_first=True`) to prepare the data for the machine learning algorithm. The Streamlit app replicates this exact preprocessing for user inputs to ensure consistent predictions.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the app running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/salary-prediction-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/salary-prediction-app.git)
    cd salary-prediction-app
    ```
    (Replace `your-username/salary-prediction-app.git` with your actual repository URL)

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If you don't have a `requirements.txt` yet, create one with `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing `streamlit`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`)*

4.  **Ensure Model File Exists:**
    Make sure your trained model file, `salary_prediction_model.pkl`, is present in the root directory of the project. This file is generated by running your `Salary Prediction.ipynb` notebook. If it's missing, run the notebook to train and save the model.

5.  **Verify `JOB_TITLES` in `app.py`:**
    **Crucial Step:** Open `app.py` and ensure the `JOB_TITLES` list precisely matches the **55 unique job title column names** (after one-hot encoding with `drop_first=True`) that your model was trained on. You can obtain this exact list from your `Salary Prediction.ipynb` by inspecting the column names of your processed DataFrame *before* feeding it into the model (e.g., `df_final.columns.tolist()`, then filter for job title columns).

## 🚀 Usage

Once the setup is complete, run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
